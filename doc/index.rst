**PyRK** is a python package for nuclear reactor kinetics. It uses a point
reactor kinetics model and provides an object oriented simulation environment
intended for transient simulations for reactors. It should perk you right up,
like a good cup of coffee.

**PyRK** welcomes your contributions. It already relies on many libraries in
the Scientific Python ecosystem including `numpy`_, `scipy`_, `pint`_, and
`matplotlib`_.

History
-------

PyRK was originally developed for analysis of accident transients in the
Pebble-Bed, Fluoride-Salt-Cooled, High-Temperature Reactor (`PB-FHR`_) design. It was
originally written by Kathryn Huff who is supported by the Nuclear Science and
Security Consortium (`NSSC`_) as well as the `FHR Project`_ and the Berkeley
Institute for Data Science (`BIDS`_) at Berkeley.  Colleagues that contributed
feedback in this endeavor include Xin Wang, Per Peterson, Ehud Greenspan, and
Massimiliano Fratoni at the University of California Berkeley.

PyRK Tutorial
=============

This tutorial-by-example has not yet been created. For now, to determine the
proper use of PyRK, check out the tests as well as the :doc:`examples`.

In a very simple sense, a pyrk simulation is typically run with:


.. code-block:: bash

   python /path/to/pyrk/driver.py --infile=infile --plotdir=out 


In the example above, path/to/pyrk is, of course, the path to the pyrk 
directory, containing driver.py.

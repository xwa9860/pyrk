# PyRK

Welcome to PyRK. This is a solver tool for coupled neutronic and thermal
hydraulic reactor transient analysis in 0-D. It is in active development.
Please correspond directly with the author for suggestions about use,
additional documentation, etc.

## Installation

Detailed instructions will be present in the upcoming user's guide. However,
for now, install this as you would any other pure python module

    python setup.py install

If you use --prefix, be sure to add the path to your PYTHONPATH environment
variable.

## Documentation

The documentation for pyrk can be found at 
[pyrk.github.io](http://pyrk.github.io). Additionally, the entire contents of that 
website can be built from the doc directory in the source code using the 
following steps

1. `pip install sphinx` 
2. `pip install sphinx_rtd_theme`.
3. `sphinx-apidoc --separate --force --output-dir=src/ ../pyrk`
4. `make clean`
5. `make html`

After these steps, the website will be found in `pyrk/doc/_build/html`.

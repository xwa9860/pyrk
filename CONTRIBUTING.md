### Thanks for Your Help!

Contributing is so kind of you. In pyrk, all contributions, bug reports, bug
fixes, documentation improvements, enhancements and ideas are welcome.

The [GitHub "issues" tab](https://github.com/pyrk/pyrk/issues)
contains some issues labeled "first PR". Those are open issues that would be a
good quick way to get started. Browse them to see if you want to get started on
one.

#### Bug Reports

  - Please include a short but detailed, self-contained Python snippet or
    explanation for reproducing the problem.

  - Explain what the expected behavior was, and what you saw instead.

##### Pull Requests

  - **Make sure the test suite passes** on your computer. To do so, run `nosetests` in the tests directory.
  - Please reference relevant Github issues in your commit message using `GH1234`
    or `#1234`. 
  - Changes should be PEP8 compatible [PEP8](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
  - Keep style fixes to a separate commit to make your PR more readable.
  - Docstrings ideally follow the [sphinx autodoc](https://pythonhosted.org/an_example_pypi_project/sphinx.html#function-definitions)
  - Write tests. 
  - When writing tests, please make sure they are in a `test` directory.
  - When you start working on a PR, start by creating a new branch pointing at the latest
    commit on github master.
  - Please avoid rebasing if possible. Nothing wrong with rebase... it is just confusing for @katyhuff .
  - The pyrk copyright policy is detailed in the pyrk [LICENSE](https://github.com/pyrk/pyrk/blob/master/LICENSE).
